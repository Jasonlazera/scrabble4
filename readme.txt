GUI Programming I - Assignment 5

My program works as expected for the most part, but it is missing a good amount of features.
Some of these features include, the board being cleared after each word played, the board
not resetting automatically after a word is played, and pieces not bouncing back to the rack.
My game also does not check for words in the dictionary which means technically any word
the user tries to create will be considered valid. I tried my best to incorporate at least the 
foundation of the game, but ran out of time to do much more than that. Vijaya and I shared
our logic for most of the functions in the javascript file
